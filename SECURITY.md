## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report using the "*Report a security vulnerability*" issue template.
We look at it daily but may not be able to answer swiftly, please, **be patient**.

If the vulnerability is accepted we need some time to find a fix (if you don't provide one) 
and to test the fix thorougly, but we will try to evolve as fast as possible, specially 
for high-severity and zero-days.

If we decline, you can try to show us that the issue is relevant by showing more details 
and we can reevaluate, but if don't choose to accept it them you are free to divulge your 
findings if you see fit.

Thanks in advance for any contributions to enhance the security of our project.
